# Implementation Guide

Review example app code to use the SitePoint SDK with Bluetooth and NTRIP.

## Overview

These are the high-level steps required to prepare your app for interfacing with the SitePoint SDK:

1. Declare [permissions](B2_Permissions.md) for Bluetooth and Location Services.

2. [Set up Bluetooth](B3_Bluetooth_Setup.md) to handle Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) scanning and connections.

3. Use [message handling](B4_Message_Handling.md) to query the connected SitePoint peripheral and to send and receive data.

5. Add handling for [NTRIP](B5_NTRIP.md) connection management and RTCM parsing for aiding a SitePoint.
