# Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation guide outlines the high-level steps required to prepare your app for interfacing with the SitePoint SDK using Bluetooth and NTRIP:

1. Declare [permissions](B2_Permissions.md) for Bluetooth and Location Services.

2. [Set up Bluetooth](B3_Bluetooth_Setup.md) to handle Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) scanning and connections.

3. Implement [message handling](B4_Message_Handling.md) to query the connected SitePoint peripheral and to send and receive data.

5. Implement [NTRIP](B5_NTRIP.md) handling, including functionality for connecting to an NTRIP server, validating and filtering received RTCM messages, and utilizing these messages to aid and augment the positioning of a SitePoint device.
