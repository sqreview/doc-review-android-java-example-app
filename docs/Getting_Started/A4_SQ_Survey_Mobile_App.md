# SQ Survey Mobile App

## Overview

SQ Survey is a full-featured mobile app developed by SignalQuest for surveying and related use cases. Although the source code is not available for this app, it demonstrates the type of app that can be developed using the SitePoint SDK.

SQ Survey includes additional features that are not part of the SitePoint SDK but were developed within the app itself using the SDK.

> **_Note:_** Some of these additional features in SQ Survey include:
> - Displaying the SitePoint location on a map
> - Storing points collected with the SitePoint into projects
> - Querying an NTRIP caster and displaying a list of mountpoints available
> - Storing multiple NTRIP server configurations
> - NTRIP logging of RTCM messages and errors
> - NTRIP reconnect handling

SQ Survey can be used for reference to expand upon the concepts included in the example app.
