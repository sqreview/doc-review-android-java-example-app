# SQ Survey Mobile App

A full-featured app developed by SignalQuest for surveying and related use cases.

## Overview

Although source code is not available for this app, it does demonstrate the type of app which can be developed using the SitePoint SDK.

It includes additional features which are not part of this SDK, but were developed within the app itself and using the SDK.

> **_Note:_** Some of these additional features in SQ Survey include:
> - Displaying the SitePoint location on a map
> - Storing points collected with the SitePoint into projects
> - Querying an NTRIP caster and displaying a list of mountpoints available
> - Storing multiple NTRIP server configurations
> - NTRIP logging of RTCM messages and errors
> - NTRIP reconnect handling

SQ Survey can be used for reference to expand upon the concepts included in the example app.
