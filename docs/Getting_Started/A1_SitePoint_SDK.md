# SitePoint SDK

The SitePoint Android SDK allows developers to interface with SignalQuest's SitePoint GNSS devices from their Android apps.

## Obtaining the SDK

The [SitePoint Android SDK](https://github.com/signalquest/SitePoint-Android-SDK) is available on GitHub. 

## SDK Documentation in Javadoc

The Android SDK is annotated using Javadoc, which allows developers to view inline code references when developing against the SDK.

A browsable, [web-based version of the documentation](https://sqreview.github.io/doc-review-android-sdk) is also available.
